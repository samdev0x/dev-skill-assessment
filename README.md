# Dev Skill Assessment

My CS fundamentals and problem-solving drills.

## Progress Log

### Section 1 - Fundamentals

**Day 1**
- **Stack (push, pop, peek):** Learned difference between return vs. log. Added snapshot return.
- **Queue (enqueue, dequeue, front, size, isEmpty):** Learned guarding before mutation, snapshot return, null safety.

**Day 2**
- Rebuilt Stack and Queue in the functional style. Much faster this time (30 minutes total vs. ~2 hours on Day 1).
- Added an `inspect()` function to return snapshots of the array safely.
- Translated both Stack and Queue into **OOP (class-based) versions** with clean encapsulation and null guards.
