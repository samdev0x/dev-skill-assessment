# Dev Skill Assessment

My CS fundamentals and problem-solving drills.

## Learning Approach

I’m following a structured cycle for each topic:
1. Go through the theory.
2. Try to understand the task clearly.
3. Attempt to solve it alone (without looking at solutions).
4. Get feedback on my approach (not full solutions, but guidance).
5. Re-try and adjust until the implementation is correct.
6. Once working, either:
   - Refactor into OOP (class-based) style, or
   - Add 1–2 extra functions for practice,  
   before moving on to the next topic.

This method has worked well so far — I notice clear improvements and faster problem-solving between Day 1 and Day 2.

## Progress Log

### Section 1 - Fundamentals

**Day 1**
- **Stack (push, pop, peek):** Learned difference between return vs. log. Added snapshot return.
- **Queue (enqueue, dequeue, front, size, isEmpty):** Learned guarding before mutation, snapshot return, null safety.

**Day 2**
- Rebuilt Stack and Queue in the functional style. Much faster this time (30 minutes total vs. ~2 hours on Day 1).
- Added an `inspect()` function to return snapshots of the array safely.
- Translated both Stack and Queue into **OOP (class-based) versions** with clean encapsulation and null guards.
